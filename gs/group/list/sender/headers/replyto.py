best reflect these odd views.'''

:returns: Either:

    * The email address from the :mailheader:`From` header if the
      ``replyto`` property of the list-object is set to ``sender``. This is
      the default for announcement groups, as few group members can post to
      the group.
    * Both the email-address in the :mailheader:`From` header and the
      email-address of the group if the ``replyto`` property of the
      list-object is set to ``both``. (Yes, the :mailheader:`Reply-To`
      header can contain an *address-list* according to
      :rfc:`5322#section-3.6.2`.)
    * The email address for the group in all other cases. This is the
      default for most groups.
